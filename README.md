# WELCOME TO CRAFT AND COCKTAIL CLUB.

Craft and Cocktail Club is a webite site for a social arts and crafts club in Galway. It is a hub for information and pictures for its community as well as a platform to attract new members. It is targeted towards arts, crafts, and cocktail entusiasts who enjoy the social aspect of a club and the informal setting of a bar. It will be used for craft and cocktail lovers to book their place on upcoming meetups as well as view the gallery of past meet ups, see what the monthly craft focus is and view a how-to video, and see the bespoke cocktail of the month suggested by the venue- Galway City Distillery.

__
## UX/UI:

Target Audience - Crafters who like to be social.
I wanted a simple design easy to read and navigate but whos images would communicate the most of the club- The images, layout , design amd text all need to convey that it is a fun, enjoyablke atmosphere, with an inclusivivity at the forefront. Peope can see the months craft focus, watch a tutorial and book to join for whatever date that suits. The navigation and site is simple to allow for creative people of all ages who may not be tech savy.

**Site Goals:**

The goal of the site is to act as a community hub of information for its members where they can 
* clearly see what craft the members are focusing on
* what bespoke cocktail has been designed for them
* book their spot on a chosen date
* acts as a source of inspiration and pride - through sharing past work of the mebers,
* a source of knowledge - with a monthly how to video on the chosen topic and a site that captures the spirit of the group. 
* A fun free and welcoming atmosphere to attract new members.


**Colour choice:**

* #DC143C (Crimson)
* #fffbff (Pale pink)

   * Inspired by the color choice of https://annajona.is/ landing page, I wanted the overall feel to be more clean and calm. 
   I chose only one color as the font weights made an impact on the vibrancy of the color and I didn't like that darker reds appeared too brown or purple. I chose a very pale pink background to help with readability.

**Font:**
* Google Fonts - Abril Fatface and Poiret One, sans serif as a back up. They are Elegent, yet not too serious and easily readable especially with the styled letter spacing.

**Imagery:**
 
* As a site targeting creatives I knew spending the time finding the right images would be incredibly important. The chosen imagery sets the tone of the page, the type of craft that is celebrated with the club and the spirit of the community itself.

**Hero image:** 
* The hero image took me a long time to find but is truly the perfect visual being a hand embroidered cocktail. I do not own the rights to this visual and it is used for educational use only. Credit is in the Credits section.

**Wireframes:**

* Wireframes were made with Balsamiq and can be found [here](assets/wireframes)
I chose not to go with the circular styling as I didnt like the top heavy visual balance on the screen.
I also chose not to float the welcome text or form ontop of the images as I wanted to keep everything simple, clean and easy to read while not compromising the visual language communicated by the images.

## BUGS FIXED:

* Nav bar not flush with side in bigger screen- removed margin in media query
* Images sticking to the left after resizing- added display flex
* Added containers around map to fit in flex display
* img - width 100% instead of max-width
* Video container - #video-container/ #video.container , also had missed the @media query tag to change the size.
* Form with flexbox - had to undo lots of styling to uncover my mistake. I needed to add 50% with to #form
* Images joined together on home page - added margin

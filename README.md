Craft and Cocktail Club.

Craft and Cocktail Club is a webite site for a social arts and crafts club in Galway. It is a hub for information and pictures for its community as well as a platform to attract new members . It is targeted towards arts, crafts, and cocktail entusiasts who enjoy the social aspect of a club and the informal setting of a bar. I will be used for craft and cocktail lovers to book their place on upcoming meetups as well as view the gallery of past meet ups and how-to videos, and see the bespoke cocktail of the week suggested by the venue- Galway City Distillery.

FEATURES

Nav bar
Font
Google Fonts - Abril Fatface and Poiret One, sans serif as a back up. Elegent, readable yet not too serious.

Colour choice
inspired by the color choice of https://annajona.is/ landing page. yet I want the overall feel to be more calm.
I chose only one color as the font weights made an impact on the vibrancy of the color and I didnt like that darker read were too brown or purple.

# WELCOME TO CRAFT AND COCKTAIL CLUB.

Craft and Cocktail Club is a webite site for a social arts and crafts club in Galway. It is a hub for information and pictures for its community as well as a platform to attract new members. It is targeted towards arts, crafts, and cocktail entusiasts who enjoy the social aspect of a club and the informal setting of a bar. It will be used for craft and cocktail lovers to book their place on upcoming meetups as well as view the gallery of past meet ups, see what the monthly craft focus is and view a how-to video, and see the bespoke cocktail of the month suggested by the venue- Galway City Distillery.

## UX/UI:

Target Audience - Crafters who like to be social.
I wanted a simple design easy to read and navigate but whos images would communicate the most of the club- The images, layout , design amd text all need to convey that it is a fun, enjoyablke atmosphere, with an inclusivivity at the forefront. Peope can see the months craft focus, watch a tutorial and book to join for whatever date that suits. The navigation and site is simple to allow for creative people of all ages who may not be tech savy.

###Site Goals:

The goal of the site is to act as a community hub of information for its members where they can 
* clearly see what craft the members are focusing on
* what bespoke cocktail has been designed for them
* book their spot on a chosen date
* acts as a source of inspiration and pride - through sharing past work of the mebers,
* a source of knowledge - with a monthly how to video on the chosen topic and a site that captures the spirit of the group. 
* A fun free and welcoming atmosphere to attract new members.


* ### Colour choice:
inspired by the color choice of https://annajona.is/ landing page. yet I want the overall feel to be more calm.
I chose only one color as the font weights made an impact on the vibrancy of the color and I didnt like that darker read were too brown or purple. 

A gallery is there to show off peoples achievemetns and to communicate the fun the group has, the community atmosphere and the inspiration to attract new members.

HERO IMAGE: 
As a site targeting creatives I knew spending the time finding the right images would be incredibly important. imagery sets the tone of the page , the type of craft that is celebrated with the community and the spirit of the club itself. 

The hero image took me a long time to find but is truly the perfect visual. I do not own the rights to this visual and it is used for educational use only.

Craft and Cocktail Club is a webite site for a social arts and crafts club in Galway. It is a hub for information and pictures for its community as well as a platform to attract new members. It is targeted towards arts, crafts, and cocktail entusiasts who enjoy the social aspect of a club and the informal setting of a bar. It will be used for craft and cocktail lovers to book their place on upcoming meetups as well as view the gallery of past meet ups, see what the monthly craft focus is and view a how-to video, and see the bespoke cocktail of the month suggested by the venue- Galway City Distillery.

## UX/UI:

 Site Goals:
The goal of the site is to act as a community hub of information for its members where they can clearly see what craft the members are focusing on, what bespoke cocktail has been designed for them. A place for members to book their spot, and also a source of inspiration and pride - through sharing past work of the mebers, a source of knowledge - with a monthly how to video on the chosen topic and a site that captures the spirit of the group. A fun free and welcoming atmosphere to attract new members.

● Design choices

* ### Colour choice:
inspired by the color choice of https://annajona.is/ landing page. yet I want the overall feel to be more calm.
I chose only one color as the font weights made an impact on the vibrancy of the color and I didnt like that darker read were too brown or purple. 

Target Audience - Crafters who like to be social,

I wanted a simple design easy to read and navigate but whos images would communicate the most of the club- The images, layout , design amd text all need to convey that it is a fun, enjoyablke atmosphere, with an inclusivivity at the forefront. Peope can see the months craft focus, watch a tutorial and book to join for whatever date that suits. The naavigation and site is simple to allow for creative people who may not be tech savy. 

A gallery is there to show off peoples achievemetns and to communicate the fun the group has, the community atmosphere and the inspiration to attract new members.


* ### Font:
Google Fonts - Abril Fatface and Poiret One, sans serif as a back up. Elegent, readable yet not too serious. Letter sizing is ar least 12px and spaced to allow for easier reading.

As as user I want to know what the months focus is so I can ...
